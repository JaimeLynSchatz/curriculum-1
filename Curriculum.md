###How We Are Different

**Practice, then theory**. Most traditional software learning, whether in universities, tech schools, or other online programs, **start** you with theory and exercises that are not based on real-world examples.  They make a fundamental mistake in assuming theory comes before practice.  We've found that adults need to experience building real-world systems **before* they learn the theory of programming.  Our modules lead you step by step to build applications, and then with this context, you will then learn theory.  It's a better way to learn.
