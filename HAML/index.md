haml
===

haml is a markup sytax that is whitespace sensitive.

Why important
---

We think it's better than erb, because the constraints of whitespace sensitivity lead to faster reading.  And reading code is what the majority of our time is spent doing.

How we teach it
---

We start by having everyone use erb, since it is the default rails format.  However, once we move into more advanced topics, we introduce haml.  It's important to undertand both as you'll likely work on projects that use both.
