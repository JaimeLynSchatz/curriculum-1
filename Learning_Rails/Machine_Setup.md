It is difficult to give step by step directions for setting up the environment on Linux, however, there are many articles on the web about Rails setup on Linux.  We also suggest connecting with a local [Rails Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=rails).

If you're not totally familiar with the basics of the command line, please read [introduction to the Mac OS X command line](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line).

Now, letâ€™s start setting up your development environment.

1. Install Xcode from the app store.
