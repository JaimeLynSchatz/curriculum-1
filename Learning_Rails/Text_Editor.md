Text Editor
===

If you already have a favorite text editor, stick with that.  If not, we recommend using **Sublime**.  It is powerful and easy to learn.

[Download sublime text here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

And then [watch this great introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05x1Jk4rT1A) on how to configure Sublime.  Also, don't underestimate how important it is to learn how to be efficient with your text editor.  Reading and writing text files is the main activity of a software developer.
