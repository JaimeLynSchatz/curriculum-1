#Before You Start

##Why Ruby and the Ruby on Rails Framework?

* Ruby is one of the fastest growing languages.
* Ruby and Rails are some of the most [sought after skills](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/tag/ruby-on-rails).
* Ruby on Rails has the best coummunity for [supporting beginning developers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails).
* It is easy to [get started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and be building websites from day one.
* Ruby on Rails developer salaries *start* at about $75k in the USA.


##How to Study

* **Study in blocks**.  At least 2 hours at a time, but take a short break every 60 minutes to clear your head.
* Become **comfortable with amiguity**.  Accept that in the beginning, much of what is going on is *magic*.
* The **beginning is the hardest part**, don't give up.  Trust us, it will get easier.
* Participate in our [Software Academy Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/madison-software-academy), where other students and mentors ask and answer questions all the time.
* Use [google](http://google.com) when you get stuck. Copy and paste errors into google. Your problem is probably something someone else has already had.
* Join a local RoR [meetup](http://meetup.com) to find a mentor to help you once in a while.  We are always looking to help new developers.
* Most importantly, you need to **drive yourself to succeed**.  No outside pressures will be forcing you to learn.

##How we Teach

* Learning by doing.  From day one you'll be building database driven web applications.
* We provide online *office hours* (via Skype and Google Hangouts) for those students who reach out for it.  You choose how much help you get.
* We expect you to have a laptop.  We hope it is a mac. We'll help you setup your environment.
* You will build more and more complex applications as you continue the course.
* We teach theory in the **middle** of the course, after you've been introduced to Ruby and Rails, so you can understand the context. This makes us different (and better) than most.
* You will work on a real live production system before you graduate.

##Be Tenacious

Really. Becoming a web developer is not rocket science.  **BUT** it does take a lot of hard work and **perseverence**.  We are here to help you make it through, but unlike traditional schools, we're not going to continually remind you to turn in your homework (there isn't any) nor threaten you with bad grades (none of those either).

Set weekly goals for yourself and don't give up.  Some people can work on this program 30 hours a week, others only have 10.  In either case, you can **fundamentally change your life** in a matter of months.  It might be 3 months or it might be 9 months, but **the skill will last a lifetime** if you work at it.
