#Before You Start

##Why Ruby and the Ruby on Rails Framework?

Ruby is one of the fastest growing languages, while Ruby on Rails is one of the most [sought after skills](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/tag/ruby-on-rails).  Rails also has the best coummunity for [supporting beginning developers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails) and even though it is a big framework that does **amazing** things for you, it is easy to [get started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and be building websites from day one.  One last item, Ruby on Rails developer salaries *start* at about $75k in the USA.


##How to Study

It is important that you are **comfortable with amiguity**.  In the beginning, most of what you are working with seems like *magic* - in time you will begin understanding the magic. The **beginning is the hardest part**, don't give up.  Trust us, it will get easier.

It's important that you take a very active part in this process, so participate in our [Software Academy Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/madison-software-academy), where other students and mentors ask and answer questions all the time.  Like most developers (even very experienced ones) use [google](http://google.com) when you get stuck. Copy and paste errors into google. Your problem is probably something someone else has already had.

Lasly, join a local Ruby on Rails [meetup](http://meetup.com) to find a mentor to help you once in a while.  Experienced developers are willing to help new developers.  It's part of the culture. Most importantly, you need to **drive yourself to succeed**.  No outside pressures will be forcing you to learn.

##Be Tenacious

Becoming a web developer is not rocket science,  **BUT** it does take a lot of hard work and **perseverence**.  We are here to help you make it through, but unlike traditional schools, we're not going to continually remind you to turn in your homework (there isn't any) nor threaten you with bad grades (none of those either).

Set weekly goals for yourself and don't give up.  Some people can work on this program 30 hours a week, others only have 8.  In either case, you can **fundamentally change your life** in a matter of months.  It might be 3 months or it might be 9 months, but **the skill will last a lifetime** if you work at it.

##Begin With the End In Mind

[Steven Covey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) spoke about 7 habits.  One of those habits was to *Begin with the End in Mind*.  Well the end of this course is a job as a **professional web developer**, with all the joy, promise, reward, and freedom that brings.
