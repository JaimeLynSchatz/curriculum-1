Understanding and effectively using **git** is a foundational skill to being a professional developer.  It is important to spend the time right now to learn the basics.

Read this [great text intro](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics) and then the [interactive tutorial](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). They are both about 15 minutes.

If you would like more information, there are [git videos](http://git-scm.com/videos) as well as other documentation on the git site.
